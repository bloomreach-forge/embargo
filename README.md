# Embargo Plugin

The embargo plugin allows you to put CMS documents, assets and images under embargo, that is, it adds a flag that sets 
the documents in a confidential state. No one has access to a document under embargo unless he belongs to the group that set the embargo flag.   

# Documentation 

Documentation is available at [onehippo-forge.github.io/embargo](https://onehippo-forge.github.io/embargo)

The documentation is generated by this command:

 > mvn clean site:site
 
The output is in the docs directory; push it and GitHub Pages will serve the site automatically.
