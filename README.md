# Embargo Plugin

The embargo plugin allows you to put CMS documents, assets and images under embargo, that is, it adds a flag that sets 
the documents in a confidential state. No one has access to a document under embargo unless he belongs to the group that set the embargo flag.   

# Documentation 

Documentation is available at [bloomreach-forge.github.io/embargo](https://bloomreach-forge.github.io/embargo)

The online documentation is generated by this command from the master branch:

 > mvn -Pgithub.pages clean site:site
 
The output is in the ```/docs``` directory; push it and GitHub Pages will serve the site automatically. 

For rendering documentation on non-master branches, use the normal site command so the output will be in the ```/target``` 
and therefore ignored by Git.

 > mvn clean site:site
